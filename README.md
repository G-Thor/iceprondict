The Icelandic Pronunciation Dictionary contains manually revised transcriptions in four pronunciation variants of Icelandic: the standard pronunciation, the northern post-aspiration variant ("harðmæli"), the north-eastern variant post-aspiration + voiced pronunciation, and the southern hv-variant. For descriptions of Icelandic pronunciation variants, see the respective documents `IPA_Pronunciation.pdf` or `SAMPA_Pronunciation.pdf` (the documents have identical content but the former describes the matter using the IPA phonetic alphabet and the latter uses the SAMPA phonetic alphabet).

The file `sampa_ipa_single.tsv` contains the set of SAMPA symbols used in the dictionaries and their mappings to IPA on the one hand and on a custom developed single-character alphabet developed for use in end-to-end speech synthesis.



The project is funded by the Icelandic Government as a part of the Language Technology Programme for Icelandic 2019–2023 which is described in the following publication:
